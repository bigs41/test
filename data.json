Late 2013, I began working as an Interaction Designer at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yesplan.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yesplan<\/a>, a Ghent-based software startup.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016 I worked as a freelance digital designer for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediahuis.be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mediahuis<\/a>, one of Belgium's biggest media companies. Later that year I joined <a href=\"http:\/\/mono.company\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mono Company<\/a>, a group of digital designers with a shared love of great design and technology. Since 2018 I'm again focused on various smaller freelance projects.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com\/simonwuyts-portfolio\/about.jpg#asset:390:url\" width=\"2000\" height=\"800\" data-image=\"390\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Apart from design and code, I love playing the piano, going for a run or watching a movie in one of Ghent's beautiful cinema's. I also love coffee, so we should definitely grab one together. ☕️<\/p>",
